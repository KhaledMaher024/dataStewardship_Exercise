Most people think that cigarettes have an effect on the heart and on the lung only, 
but many of us do not know how every cigarette smoked by humans affects the liver. 
Tobacco products in all its forms have a severe effect on the liver. 
This is because the toxins that are abundant in tobacco products cause inflammation. 
And chronic signs in the liver, these infections in turn increase the susceptibility to 
liver cancer

 so the purpose of collecting this data to help smokers to git rid of these bad habbit


-----------------------------------------------------------------
the data collected contains the following information : 
(the state : String , number of livercancer Incidance : int64 , number of smoker : int64 , year : int64)

the data  stored as  CSV  file  withsize of  371 byte 			


-----------------------------------------------------------------

the data collected from 2 datasets from different websites , 
the first one is from kaggle and its about number of tobacco usage in USA state from 1995 - 2015 
and the other one was collected from data.gov website and its about liver cancer incidance in USA states from 1999 to 2010  
, i made a set of procedure on the original datasets to prepare and analyze the data to be useful and can be used , 
first of all is to check if the data has null values or not and fill the null field with the median value of the column , 
the second procedure that eleminate the rows that is out of the specified period (2000-2010) , 
then i convert the type of one column in the tobacco usage "Never smoked" by deleting the percentage mark and change the results string into float , 
then i calculated the number of smoker by substracting 1 by the value of "Never smoker" column , and also i eliminated the rows that doesnt represent liver cancer in the second dataset , 
and i make a function that work as groupby function and i added a new column that represent the summation or total # of incidance in one year for all years in the specified period , 
then i merged the 2 datasets to results the final result
